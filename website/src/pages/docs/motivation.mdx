# Motivation

Two years ago, I discovered [styled-components](https://styled-components.com), it was a game changer for all my projects. At Smooth Code, we adopted it has significantly reduced the time of development. A year later, I discovered [styled-system](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system), again it was a game-changer, being able to use prop directly based on theme is amazing.

styled-system is great, so great that I wanted to add it in the core of [Smooth UI](https://smooth-ui.smooth-code.com). Unfortunately it wasn't enough performant to be added in the core of the library. So I decided to rewrite it, improve it, add a bunch of features and fixes.

For the records, I start with [contribution in styled-system](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system/pull/479). I refactored the codebase, introduce tree shaking and severals features... Unfortunately Brent Jackson vision was not as closed as mine than expected. That's why worked on xstyled library. xstyled follows the styled system specification but evolve faster and I keep my freedom !

After one year using a system (styled-system) in our code, we push it to the next step : being able to use the system right in CSS props. Again it is a game changer and provides significant time-savings !
